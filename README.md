# VS

VS is currently just a simple project with big things in mind. Of course, I am really new to C++, so my code is definitely going to have some pretty silly practices in use. And because I'm new, a goal of making this is to improve my C++ ability. As for the application itself, the goal is to make it an RPG-style fighting simulator between one or more opponents. It's going to be moddable, so you can add your own equipment etc. And I plan on making it Fantasy themed.
